During the fall of 2022, I co-developed and co-taught an interdisciplinary undergraduate course at Stanford called "Pathogens and Populations: Representing Infectious Disease" (ENGL 102). Each week, we considered scientific and cultural (e.g., novels, board games, film) to understand and critique the ways infectious disease is represented. You can read more about the course in [this article](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/01/03/students-examine-scientific-cultural-representations-disease/) by the Stanford Report and view the course [syllabus](https://mjharris95.github.io/ENGL102-syllabus.pdf) below. I also was a teaching assistant for two courses (Biology and Global Change, Introduction to Research in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology).

I have mentored several undergraduate researchers. I supervised an undergraduate honors thesis by Ann Marie Abraham entitled "Early Warning Signal Detection for Ross River Virus in Queensland, Australia." During her sophomore year, Kimberly Cardenas worked with my to develop an [interactive website](https://mallory-harris.shinyapps.io/rshiny-divided-disease/) on modeling infectious diseases and awareness-based protective behavior.
