I am a PhD candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment & Resources ([E-IPER](https://eiper.stanford.edu/)) at Stanford University, investigating the impact of large-scale global change on infectious disease transmission and broader health dynamics. Based on the concepts of One Health and Planetary Health, I focus on the design and evaluation of win-win solutions that can synergistically benefit human and environmental health. As we anticipate widening disease disparities under increasing climate instability, my research aims to identify opportunities to prevent and mitigate these compounding harms. I approach these topics by integrating novel computational methods, field-data collection, and epidemiologic techniques.

I am currently co-advised by [Erin Mordecai](https://www.mordecailab.com/) (BIO) and [Steve Luby](https://lubylab.stanford.edu/) (MED). Prior to coming to Stanford, I was a Data Science Fellow at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where I developed analytic tools for outbreak detection and triage of multiple pathogens and supported the CDCâ€™s Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response. I conducted my undergraduate and master's research with the [People, Place & Health Collective](https://pphcollective.org/) at the Brown University School of Public Health while earning my undergraduate (BS, Applied Mathematics) and master's degrees (MA, Biostatistics).
