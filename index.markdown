I am a PhD candidate in Biology (Ecology and Evolution track) at Stanford University where I am advised by [Erin Mordecai](https://www.mordecailab.com/). I am an Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Scholar and Knight-Hennessy Scholar. I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology from the University of Georgia as a Goldwater Scholar and University of Georgia Foundation Fellow. I conducted undergraduate research and completed an honors thesis with [John Drake](https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/).  

I use quantitative methods to study the interplay between human behavior and infectious diseases: how human activity can impact epidemic dynamics and how people respond to outbreaks. I also work to improve personal and collective responses to infectious diseases by communicating my science and counteracting health misinformation. As the President of [Scientists Speak Up](https://scientistsspeakup.org/), I organize seminars and workshops on communication and advocacy around scientific topics like vaccination and climate change. I managed social media for [Girlology](https://girlology.com/), a collective of medical professionals who provide educational resources on puberty and and health for adolescents and their parents. 

As a complement to my research, I advocate for safer and healthier communities. As an undergraduate, I led campus activism on [gun violence prevention](https://momsdemandaction.org/georgia-moms-demand-action-everytown-and-gun-violence-survivors-urge-georgia-lawmakers-to-prioritize-public-safety/). I worked as Operations Director for [Maura's Voice](https://maurasvoice.org/), a nonprofit organization funding research and solutions to counter violence and hate. I also worked on political campaigns for State House Candidate Mokah Jasmine Johnson and Congresswoman Lucy McBath.
