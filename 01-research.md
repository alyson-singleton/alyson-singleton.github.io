# **Land-use change and vector-borne disease**

<img src="https://mjharris95.github.io/disease-decision.jpg" align="left" width="243"/> Unrecognized to much of the scientific community and the public, land-use change is as pervasive and threatening to human and planetary health as climate change. Over three-quarters of our Earth’s land surface has been altered by human beings during the last thousand years. Land-use change, or the intensification of human pressure imposed upon land, transforms natural environments into agricultural or urban areas. It alters biodiversity, habitat types, land cover variety, and ecological systems. Vector-borne diseases require non-human species (e.g., ticks, mosquitoes) for transmission, and are therefore particularly susceptible to these environmental changes due to their effects on vectors’ survival, reproduction, and contact with hosts. As humans impact and interact with the environment through deforestation, agricultural practices, and rapid urbanization, our vulnerability to various vector-borne diseases often increases. Land-use change is not just a physical, environmental change but also a suite of social and demographic changes, including increased mobility, novel patterns of demography and population mixing, and changes in the human-environment interface. My research incorporates these multiple facets of land-use change to better understand its impacts on multiple vector-borne diseases with differing ecologies.
