# **Science communication**

<img src="https://mjharris95.github.io/scicomm.jpg" align="left" width="243"/>

I view speaking with journalists and writing opinion pieces as an important way to share my research and counter misinformation (a list of my interviews and published pieces is available [here](https://mjharris95.github.io/media)). I organized an expert [panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahFuF1tQMfA) on the science of herd immunity in the context of Covid-19 and co-authored opinion pieces on the subject, published in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/opinion/herd-immunity-covid-us.html) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/10/herd-immunity-threshold-covid-new-variants). I have been interviewed about scientific misinformation in venues including [STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/24/stanford-professor-and-nobel-laureate-critics-say-he-was-dangerously-misleading-on-covid/), [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/ottawa-convoy-protest-promoters-elite-medical-credentials-financial-incentives-astroturf-libertarian/), and Michael Lewis' podcast [Against the Rules](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/against-the-rules/the-person-who-knows). I helped develop multiple interactive websites to help people understand [long-term interventions for Covid-19](http://covid-measures.stanford.edu/), [risk of Covid-19 associated with large events](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/), and [how protective behavior can affect disease dynamics](https://mallory-harris.shinyapps.io/rshiny-divided-disease/). I am the President of [Scientists Speak Up](https://scientistsspeakup.org/), a student organization at Stanford focused on communication and advocacy to counter scientific misinformation. You can view recordings of several of our events on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@scientistsspeakup1427).

# **Advocacy**

I am working with the [Coalition for a True School of Sustainability](https://www.truesustainabilityschool.com/) advocating for Stanford's Doerr School of Sustainability to reject fossil fuel funding. As part of this effort, I [organized a talk](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/17/from-the-community-doerrs-fossil-fuel-ties-discourage-top-scholars-from-engaging/) by Professor Naomi Oreskes on how funding influences research and was quoted by [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/12/02/sustainability-school-faces-backlash-over-fossil-fuel-funds). I co-authored an [op-ed and petition](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/06/19/stanford-university-must-speak-out-against-xenophobia/) opposing xenophobic legislation that would bar Chinese nationals from attending American graduate programs in STEM fields. For Scientists Speak Up, I organized a talk on [how UN rules exclude Taiwanese scholars](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/taiwanese-scholars-slip-through-cracks-un-rules-china). As an advocate for gun violence prevention, I [spoke](https://momsdemandaction.org/georgia-moms-demand-action-everytown-and-gun-violence-survivors-urge-georgia-lawmakers-to-prioritize-public-safety/) at Moms Demand Action's Advocacy Day in Georgia, [organized](https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/march-for-our-lives-brings-support-from-oconee-athens-communities/article_958dfba2-32cc-11e8-8ff5-1f7e9e5d0081.html) rallies, and worked as the Operations Director for [Maura's Voice](https://maurasvoice.org/), which funds research on addressing hate and violence.
